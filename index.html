            Margit, the Fell Omen is one of the first bosses you meet in Elden Ring. He is a large, humanoid boss with a
            sword-like staff. He has a variety of attacks, including a charge, a slam, and a spin attack. Even though he
            is a relatively easy boss his attacks tend to be <em>misleadingly telegraphed</em> and provoke many
            beginners to dodge excessively, only to end up caught by surprise and defeated.
